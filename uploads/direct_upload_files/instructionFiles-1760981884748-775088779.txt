September 23rd, 2025, a 30-minute ICS visit, parent, Ryan, child, Jaden, FTC, Owen Oliver.
Ryan started out his visit telling me that he wouldn't be able to do the Wednesday mornings
anymore due to a class that he has to take.
I was trying to adjust some of the other times around, but his schedule wasn't allowing for them.
After this conversation, Jaden started in talking to his dad, telling him about his little boo-boo,
and telling him about school and his friends.
Jaden was showing his dad, his school ID, telling him that it can get him into the dances at the school for free.
He was telling his dad that his grandma won't let him dance with his girls.
He started explaining to his dad what he actually said was that he won't dance with girls, he'll just dance with his friends.
He also told his dad that he didn't want to talk to his mom about that, that he'll make a big deal of other things.
He started to wrap up their conversation shortly after this because the time was running out.
They said their goodbyes before the call ended.
